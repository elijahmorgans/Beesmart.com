<p><h4>"My mother always told me that stories have the power to change a person and I wanted to change the world,<br>so I started writing until it became my professional adventure.
    <div> I hope my story can help inspire you all as well."</h4></div></p>
    <p><div>"Hello everyone, my name is Ali junior yeyenga, and I work as an educator at a non profite company.</div>
         <div>As a child, I would sit in a group of kids and provide free mentorship services to kids my age to motivate them for life.</div>
          <div>Looking back at my journey, I can say that those group mentoring sessions helped me realise my purpose of uplifting others.</div> 
            It helped me see, believe and position myself as a leader that today I provide group coaching worldwide.
<div>
            "Consultancy in the corporate world is a growing and essential domain.</div></p><br>
             <p><div>I have seen people grow and strengthen with good consultancies and people shutting down with bad consultancy advice.</div>
              I worked to separate the two by helping young adults grow their presence in a local and global way .<br>
               More than educational expertise, self-belief, confidence and a genuine motivation to see young adults grow helped me succeed in my profession.
                Today,<br> I see myself in all of you who have attended this event/opened this site.<br></p>
            <div>"I used to listen to speeches from various people and always thought, 'what could I learn from their experiences?'<br>
         I know you are in the same place. Still, if I were to share openly, I would say—take passion,<br> take patience and perseverance from my story and add it to your own because I already see you all in positions of authority.<br>
          I am confident that I will hear your stories of excellence and resilience soon.
           Thank you so much for being here  today and allowing me to share my story with you."

        <h2>DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME</h2><br>
        <p><div>short motivational video tells us to take every opportunity we can to learn and make</div>
             ourselves into the people we wish to be before the moment passes and it is too late.</p>
            <br>
            <p><DIV>We must take the time to read books and new information –
                 we should always have the goal</DIV> <div>expand our minds whilst we pursue our missions of the present.</div><div>
                 Many of us all too often will waste that precious time in things that put up barriers against our dreams.</div>
                  <div>time can never be brought back so make sure you savour every moment and use it to your full potential.</div>
                   If something doesn’t have meaning in the grand scheme of your life, ignore it and move on.</p>

                   <p><div>can do anything you want if you just have the perseverance and the ability to try things you have never done before.</div>
                    <div>Push yourself to the very limit and remember that the only way to fail in any pursuit is to stop going for it. Believe in yourself,</div>
                    <div> put your heart and soul into it. Find your why in the world and take the action to make a difference.</div>
                    <br>

                   <div>Don’t take days off, stop the procrastination and listening to others and focus on</div> yourself, your time and what you do with it.
